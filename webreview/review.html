    <h1>At first, there was nothing.  Then all of a sudden, bang!  The internet was created.  This wonderful new technology that allowed people to access porn from the privacy of there own home.  That's what started it all.  However, as more and more websites were being created, the process of typing in a web address became tedious.  Then all of a sudden, boom!  Google was made.  With this search engine, people could now sort through all the porn sites to find the one that appealed to them.  Then all of a sudden, someone realized how hard it was to find clips of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.  Boom, YouTube was created, a centralized platform for people to post their porn.  But then things took a turn for the worst.  Suddenly all these non-porn sites started popping up all over the internet.  It was a true tragedy.  Now it took 8 milliseconds to find porn as opposed to the usual 3.  Now we live in this dark time on the internet.  A time where people spread lies, harass others, and steal each other's sensitive information.  To think, this all could've been avoided if we had just stuck to our roots.</h1>
